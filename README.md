## Developer Environment Setup

1. [Fork this project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

1. (Optional) If you installed gvm:

   ```bash
   source "${HOME}/.gvm"
   ```

1. Install pre-commit hooks and dependencies:

   ```bash
   mage installPreCommitHooks
   ```

1. Update and run pre-commit hooks locally:

   ```bash
   mage runPreCommit
   ```

1. Fill out all TODO values in `test_env` files
   for code that you want to modify and test:

   ```bash
   vi pkg/ec2/test_env # fill in TODO values
   source pkg/ec2/test_env # export the env vars
   ```

   Alternatively, you can debug with vscode by
   removing the export statements in front of each
   variable.
