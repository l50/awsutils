## Running the Tests

You'll need a bunch of environment variables to run these tests.
The easiest way to do this is to copy and fill in the provided template:

```
cp test_env_template test_env
```

Fill in all of the `export` commands in `test_env` with the appropriate values, 
then source the file to add the environment variables to your shell:

```
source test_env
```

Note that your `test_env` file is gitignored.
